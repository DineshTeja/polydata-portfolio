Gen.).","secondpara":"To predict and simulate various electoral outcomes through these models, federal election datasets from MIT's Election Data + Science Lab (President, Senate, House, etc.) were transformed into entirely numerical formats using LabelEncoders from sci-kit learn. Then, for each separate model, Random Forest Regression, an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing and iterating through multiple decision trees to reach a final prediction, was employed. These Random Forest models were continuously trained with 70% of their respective electoral dataset and tested on their prediction accuracy (via Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, etc.) using the remaining 30%. Additionally, these models' hyper-parameters (n_estimators, samples, max_features, etc.) were optimized using the Bayesian Optimization algorithm, which employs another predictive machine learning model to repeatedly execute the target model's task (while learning from each result) until the hyper-parameter set that allows for optimal accuracy/error is reached. In this way, we generated models (and accompanying visualizations) that maintained: Less than 5% Error on U.S. Presidential Election Prediction and Historical Election Simulations, Less than 8% Error on U.S. Senate Election Prediction and Historical Election Simulations, Less than 6% Error on U.S. House of Rep Election Prediction and Historical Election Simulations","imageSrc":"/images/electionpred.png","url":""},{"id":"2","title":"Inactive Voter Identification Model","dates":"Machine Learning, NLP, & Generative AI","description":"Developed through an exclusive contract with a political campaign, this model focused on analyzing historical electoral data and current polls to identify demographic groups that will likely be inactive in Arkansas elections.","secondpara":"Since there weren't any official comprehensive datasets with citizens' voting patterns and their demographic information, we merged an existing dataset of demographic information for Arkansas’ towns (via U.S. Census and AR Economic Development Institute) with state election results from 2004-2020 (via Arkansas Secretary of State’s Office) to generate a rough demographic map of Arkansas’ currently active electorate. We also classified all towns in the dataset as active (5), generally active (4), neutral (3), generally inactive (2), or inactive (1) based on their voting percentage. Then, we fed this dataset into a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network, which used a technique called back-propagation to adjust weights of the neurons (layers) in the network to generate more accurate predictions. This MLP was tasked with projecting voting activity (1-5) in the upcoming 2022 state election for all towns in the dataset. In doing so, we found that areas with a dominant Asian-American, specifically Indian and Marshallese-American, population were projected to be the most inactive voter group in the 2022 Arkansas elections. This informed the campaign’s voter outreach strategy and Mr. Price’s future public service endeavors after the conclusion of his campaign.","imageSrc":"/images/joshprice.png","url":""},{"id":"3","title":"AUNow Resources Portal","dates":"Web Development, Visualization, & Database Management","description":"Developed exclusively with Arkansas United, AUNow is Arkansas United’s All-Encompassing Resources Portal.

To analyze and understand the collected text data, we employed the BERT Natural Language Processing model (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a unique deep learning model capable of reading and interpreting text in both directions. This bi-directionality, enabled by the use of transformers, allowed it to dynamically calculate weights for different parts of text and generate a more comprehensive understanding of any text document. After applying BERT, we found that the franchise structures of the ‘NAACP’ and ‘Boys & Girls Club’ were most suitable for Arkansas United’s IRC program requirements, which we essentially input to the model through keywords and additional literature. Using the results of PolyData’s Franchise Structure Comparison Model, Arkansas United designed and launched their optimized IRC program with an improved application process, management structure, franchisee requirements, etc.","imageSrc":"/images/aulogo.png","url":""},{"id":"5","title":"Demographic Electoral Data Report Generator","dates":"Database Management, Machine Learning & Web Development","description":"Developed exclusively with Arkansas United and the Democratic Party of Arkansas, this AI-based generator was constructed to generate electoral data reports (basic statistics, understandable visualizations, relevant trend analysis, etc.) that display demographic differences and information.

When users upload a dataset (.csv format), descriptive statistics (means, standard deviation, quartiles, counts, percentages, etc.) are calculated and, to complement these statistics, visualizations (distributions, venn-diagrams, etc.) are also generated. In addition to descriptive statistics, a set of predictive analytics are also conducted, including electoral forecasting and demographic-specific voting pattern prediction. These operations are made possible through classification and regression-oriented machine learning models from scikit-learn integrated into this software. By automatically generating descriptive statistics and predictive analytics for any electoral dataset, this generator allows non-profit organizations and social businesses to more efficiently analyze and understand convoluted datasets.","imageSrc":"/images/arkdems.jpg","url":""}],"partners":[{"id":"1","title":"Democratic Party of Arkansas","imageSrc":"https://arktimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/arkdems.jpg"},{"id":"2","title":"Leukemia and Lymphoma Society","imageSrc":"https://larsonhomeservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/featured_LLS-1.jpeg"},{"id":"3","title":"Arkansas United","imageSrc":"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5b203a03b10598eab318bc71/1535153513012-KFWGLQTUHX3CK4MRTMH1/AU-Logo-vertical-lockup-R99G140B61-1000X1000.jpg"}],"services":[{"id":"1","title":"Election Simulations and Forecasting.","description":"We research, analyze, and breakdown all sorts of elections to develop efficient simulations that provide actionable insights."},{"id":"2","title":"Campaign Optimization Tools.","description":"We focus on creating usable election analysis, data management, and operation handling tools to propel political campaigns to a new level.
